/* Problem 13. Comparing Floats

    Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.

Note: Two floating-point numbers a and b cannot be compared directly by a == b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. 
Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than a fixed constant eps.
